# NcsaspChessbot
Making a Chessbot for a school project from scratch.
Trying not to use too many copy/pastes

SO, currently the code is set up so that it will try to run 100 games in succession, with 5 seconds in-between games. 
If your console works with the command 'chcp 65001' (as for some reason it's quite finnicky) run that before using the code
Also, i'm getting a bug that says that preview features aren't enabled if someone could let me know how to fix that without adding another argument into the command line let me know
