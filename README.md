# NcsaspChessbot
Hi there! I'm making a chessbot from scratch for a school project.

# Things to Know:
- Chessbot will run 1 game. Press ENTER to go to the next move.
- You MUST run "chcp 65001" to see unicode characters if it is not already enabled.

# Features:
- Visualized Board
- Rules of Chess
- Plays Random Chess Games
- Unicode Chess Pieces

# Planned Features:
- User Input
- Chessbot looking 1-2 moves ahead
- Chessbot looking 3-4 moves ahead using A-B Pruning
- Point maps?
- Better piece readout. (shows what piece moved and from where)


Hope you all enjoy!
